                    <h3>Day to day</h3>
                    <p>Me, day to day, what can I say? Ofcourse I am a CMD student at the HvA and an employee at AutoDisk, but that is not me as a person. If you ask the people around me, they'll most likely say that I'm always me. 
                    I'm not quickly influenced to change myself, ofcourse I've changed over time and more often than not, I've followed trends, but none of those trends changed anything about me as me. <br> <br>
                    But who is me? <br> <br>
                    Well, pleasure to meet you, my name is Eefje. - imagine handshake - <br> 
                    I would describe myself as rather creative, I don't shine bright like a star in one certain area but I'm triggered to create whenever I can. I'm not one of those people who have a shocking
                    talent at writing code or 3D modelling. I am one of those who just make something, anything for that matter. I wouldn't say that I'm better than anyone, what I would say though, is that I know exactly
                    who I am, and what I want for my life. But enough about my aspirations, let's talk about the most import thing in the world, fun! <br> <br>
                    For me fun equals love. Whenever I'm surrounded by people who love me and whom I love, I'm at my happiest. Wether it's Christmas, a party or simply being with friends inbetween classes,
                    those are the times you'll see me at my best. With a big smile and loud laughter, those are the times I will shine as bright as a star. </p>

                    <h3>Student</h3>
                    <p>As I said before, being a student on it's own, is not me. What it is though is a part of me. Being a student is sometimes tough, stress and lack of personal time, can weigh heavy on the mind of a teenager.
                    But don't get me wrong, if you ask anyone, they'll tell you that I might not always feel like going to school, but they know how important it is to me. I am astonished by how much I've already learned,
                    I knew nothing about code, nor did I know exactly how difficult it can be to design for someone. <br> <br>
                    Before I started my studies, I went to highschool like anyone else. I wasn't a great student there, I noticed that how others were excellent in math and economics, I never seemed to get amazing grades. 
                    When I started here, at my current studies, I got those amazing grades I dreamed about. Why? You guessed it; I found the place where my creativity wasn't discouraged, but seen as a positive. <br> <br>
                    So, yes, being a student isn't always easy, but if everything was easy, nothing would be worth any work.

                    <h3>Employee</h3>
                    <p>As a twenty year old, working is encouraged, add being a student up to that and working is required. I worked a sidejob in retail, which taught me a lot. I learned how to work for someone and how to lead,
                    I learned about consequences and rewards for a job well done. I left there because I also learned that there were a lot of things I didn't want to learn. I wanted to learn about things I was interested in. <br> <br>
                    I started a proper job at my father's company, a company that sells software to calculate the price of leasecars. I work only a few hours in a week but I have come to realise that starting this job has taught me even more than my previous job did.
                    I now have contact with my colleagues and I am trusted with difficult problems. I have grown more responsible while working at AutoDisk.
