                        <h3>Visual</h3>
                        <p>I would say I'm most drawn to the visual side of our work. As a child I was always working on a form of arts and crafts. Anything where I could make something was a hit. And to this day, I still love to paint, draw, clay, you name it.
                        At school we are encouraged to get out of our chairs and creat something offline. Drawing is perhaps the most obvious, when it's appropriate I include my drawings in my work. But it doesn't stay at that,
                        I've recently discoverd the posibility to draw with code. You'll find one of these drawings at the bottom of this page if you're interested. What I'm trying to say, is that I have and interest and, according to me, a talent when it
                        comes to Visual work. <br> <br>
                        But visual on it's own ... <br>
                        No, nothing wrong with it, but not for me.
                        </p>
                    </article>
    
                    <p>“A strong visual imagination acts as a magnet to draw the visualised into reality.”</p>
    
                    <article>
                        <h3>Interaction</h3>
                        <p>So, where did we leave off? <br>
                        Ah yes, not just visual. <br> 
                        How about interaction then? <br> <br>
                        I think interaction is the key to a users heart. More often than not the user doesn't even notice precisely how much work is put into one simple action. But behind that one action, there have been at least a few brains cracking to make that interaction perfect. 
                        The users don't even realise it, but those smooth and flawless interactions are the very reason, the application works as well as it does. Bad interactions are much more noticeable than the good ones. <br> <br>
                        I have tried interaction a few times and I must say, I haven't quite mastered it jet. So I decided that I shoud keep trying. After my internship with (hopefully) you, I'll start a few subjects of my chosing. 
                        Well my choice was simple, I should keep trying, interaction it is. <br> <br>
                        Now don't be alarmed, I'm fine at interaction work, I'm just trying to say that I still have a lot to learn. And where better to learn than with you. <br>
                        Can you just imagine?<br>
                        I come back from my awesome internship and I'm a king, or rather a queen, at interaction work. <br>
                        Can you imagine the shock on their faces? <br>
                        We did that!

                        <h3>Technology</h3>
                        <p>And there we have it; technology. <br>
                        When I applied for CMD I was most exicited, but also most frightened, about tech. There is a reason why some people praise programmers as much as doctors; It's not easy.
                        You have to be commited and eager to learn. Which, surprise surprise, I am. I still have a long way to go and today I'm fluent in only HTML and CSS. But Javascript is slowly coming along 
                        and we're currently learning about Arduino. <br> <br>
                        Let's just say it like it is, I love writing code, but only code I understand. I think all programmers got my back on this one; it's all fun and games, till you get that one big problem you can't seem to fix. <br>
                        But that rush you get when you do fix it ... <br>
                        I think I could only compare it to the feeling I got when I passed my driverstest whilest my legs felt like wet french fries. <br>
                        You just can't believe the incredible intellectual power you hold. "I should get a Nobel!" <br>
                        Don't mind the exaggeration, but you get what I mean.
